## Guidelines

Firstly, this repo is meant for FREE resources only! In the form of PDFs, DOCs and free online course and so on.
They must be a direct link to the resources, without any redirection or third-party site!

### How to Contribute

- [**Fork the Repo**](https://github.com/EOEboh/Free-Software-Books/fork). Next, (optional) create a branch for the issue you are working on. After changes have been made, commit to your branch.
- Create a **pull request**, the maintainers will review and approve is there are no conflicts.
- In the event where you have conflict, please resolve the conflicts in your PR
- Maintainers will also vert links to ensure no malicious / inappropriate links have been provided.


### Structure

There are three major folders in the repo:

- books
- courses
- docs

Each of these folders contain category sub-folder, please kindly put the resource you are adding under the appropriate folder. For example, if you are adding a coding e-book on React, the appropriate location should be: `books > dev-books > React > react.md`. The same rule applies to other kinds of resources.

- The `books` folder is meant for direct links to FREE tech e-books in PDF and DOC formats preferably.
- The `courses` folder is meant for direct links to FREE online courses around tech subjects.
- The `docs` folder is meant for direct links to FREE documentation, articles and discussions around any tech subjects.

### Formatting

- Please when contributing, arrange it in alphabetical order.

- If the name of the resource you are adding begins with a number or special character, kindly add it at the very bottom of the appropriate list.

- The format should be in a markdown link with a target as '\_blank'. For example:

```
[Eloquent JavaScript](#Link-to-eloquent-javascript){:target="_blank"}
```

This document will be further improved on, as time goes on.
Thank you!
